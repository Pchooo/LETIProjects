## Projects performed during the course: construction and analysis of the algorithm

### Backtraking
    The purpose of this work was to study backtracking. A recursive backtracking algorithm was implemented to solve the task of minimizing costs. 
    
    
### Graphs
    The aim of the work was to develop a program that solves the problem of constructing the shortest path in a directed graph using the A* method, a greedy algorithm, as well as Dijkstra's algorithm.
    
### Flow Network
    The aim of the work was to develop a program that solves the problem of finding the maximum flow in the network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    
### Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm
    The purpose of the work was to study the work of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for searching for a substring in a string, and the development of a program implementing the algorithm. Memory optimization was performed - O(m), m is the length of the sample.
    
    
###Aho–Corasick algorithm
    The aim of the work was to develop a program that solves the problem of accurately searching for a set of samples. The Aho-Korasik algorithm is used.
