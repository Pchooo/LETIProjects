##Binary tree

######The purpose of this work was to study such a data structure as a tree.
Pointers are used in the implementation, recursive functions were used for processing.

###### The following tasks were set:
For a given binary tree with an arbitrary type of elements:
- get a forest naturally represented by this binary tree;
- output an image of a binary tree and a forest;
- list the elements of the forest in horizontal order (in width).
